## Unit testing
Unit tests are based on [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/ "Jasmine on GitHub") and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io "Karma on GitHub").

To run all tests, you use the command

`$ ng test`

The documentation for writing unit tests can be found on the [DOCs page](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html "Jasmine documentation") on the Jasmine website.


## Documentation generation
The generation of the documentation is done with [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc "TypeDoc on GitHub").

To create a documentation for the entire project, you can use the command

`$ typedoc --out path/to/documentation/`

All information about commands and arguments are listed in the [Usage section](http://typedoc.org/guides/usage/ "TypeDoc website") on the TypeDoc website.
